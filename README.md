##Final Project for STAT331

This project delineates the analysis of the customer churn rate of TKT using the given data of both past and present customers. Through predictive analysis using Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forests, we managed to predict future customer churn with a Sensitivity of 76%. With this information, TKT will be better prepared to take appropriate measures to increase customer retention.
